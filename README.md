  **⚠️ WARNING: DISCORD TOS VIOLATION - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ☠**

</div>

## 📖 About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="./image.png" alt="EXTER Screenshot" width="800">
</div>

**EXTER** is a powerful Discord selfbot tool that enables multiple user accounts to connect to voice channels simultaneously using WebSocket connections. Built with Node.js, this tool demonstrates advanced WebSocket implementation for interacting with Discord's voice gateway.

> 🎯 **Educational Purpose Only:** This project is for learning about WebSocket connections and Discord's API structure. Using this tool violates Discord's Terms of Service and may result in account termination.

### ✨ Features

- 🔗 **Mass Voice Joining:** Connect unlimited accounts to a single voice channel
- 🔄 **Auto-Reconnection:** Maintains connections with 5-minute reconnection intervals
- ✅ **Token Validation:** Verifies token validity before establishing connections
- 🎨 **Colorful Console Interface:** Beautiful terminal output with ANSI colors
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Efficient:** Minimal resource consumption
- 🔧 **Simple Configuration:** Easy setup via `config.json` file
- 📊 **Real-time Status:** Live connection status and token validation
- 🛡️ **Secure Token Handling:** Local token storage only

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or higher) installed
- Discord account tokens (obtained responsibly for educational purposes)
- Server (Guild) ID and Voice Channel ID where you have permission to join

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raha📝 Usage
Basic Executiont-cmd/exter.git
   cd exter
   Install dependencies:---->
   npm install
   onfigure the settings

Edit config.json with your Discord server information:----->
{
  "GUILD_ID": "YOUR_SERVER_ID_HERE",
  "VC_CHANNEL": "YOUR_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID_HERE",
  "MUTED": true,
  "DEAFEN": true,
  "VIDEO": false
}
Note: Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings to easily copy IDs
Add your Discord tokens

Open tokens.txt and add tokens (one per line):----->
your_first_token_here
your_second_token_here
your_third_token_here

🔒 SECURITY WARNING: Never share your tokens.txt file! Anyone with your tokens can control those Discord accounts.
Run the application:---->
node index.js

⚠️ Critical Warnings & Disclaimer
Discord Terms of Service Violation
This tool EXPLICITLY VIOLATES Discord's Terms of Service in multiple ways:

❌ Selfbot Usage: Automating user accounts is strictly prohibited

❌ Account Automation: Using scripts to control user accounts violates ToS

❌ Mass Operations: Coordinated actions across multiple accounts is against Discord's policies

❌ Voice Channel Abuse: Joining voice channels with multiple automated accounts

Potential Consequences
🔴 Account Termination: All connected Discord accounts may be permanently banned

🔴 IP Ban: Your IP address could be blocked from accessing Discord

🔴 Hardware Ban: In severe cases, Discord may implement hardware bans

🔴 Server Action: The target server may ban all involved accounts

🔴 Legal Implications: While unlikely, Discord could pursue legal action for ToS violations

Recommended Safety Guidelines
Use Alt Accounts Only: Never use your main Discord account with this tool

Private Testing Only: Test only in servers you own or have explicit permission

Limit Scale: Start with 2-3 tokens, not hundreds

Monitor Activity: Watch for unusual Discord behavior or warnings

Assume Risk: Be prepared for accounts to be lost - consider them disposable

Educational Focus: Use this tool to learn about WebSockets, not for disruption

🔧 Troubleshooting Guide
Common Issues & Solutions
Problem	Solution	Details
"tokens.txt not found"	Create tokens.txt in project directory	Ensure file exists and is in the same folder as index.js
"No tokens found"	Add valid tokens to tokens.txt	One token per line, no empty lines
"Invalid Guild ID"	Verify Server ID in config.json	Enable Developer Mode in Discord to copy correct ID
"Cannot join voice"	Check Voice Channel ID and permissions	Ensure tokens have access to the server/channel
Token shows "INVALID"	Token may be expired or revoked	Generate new tokens if necessary
Connection drops frequently	Check internet stability	Discord may be rate-limiting your connections
Script crashes on startup	Ensure Node.js v16+ is installed	Update Node.js to latest LTS version
WebSocket connection errors	Check firewall/antivirus settings	Allow Node.js through firewall

How to Get Discord IDs
Open Discord Settings → Advanced

Enable "Developer Mode"

Right-click on server icon → "Copy ID"

Right-click on voice channel → "Copy ID"

Understanding Discord Tokens
Educational Note: Discord tokens are authentication keys that allow applications to act on behalf of a user account. They should be treated with the same security as passwords.

❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: Is this tool safe to use?
A: No. This tool violates Discord's Terms of Service. Using it risks account termination. It is intended for educational purposes only to understand WebSocket connections and Discord's API structure.

Q: How many tokens can I use simultaneously?
A: Technically unlimited, but practical limits apply:

Technical Limit: Depends on your system resources

Risk Factor: More tokens = higher detection risk

Recommended: 2-5 tokens for educational testing

Q: Will Discord detect this immediately?
A: Discord has sophisticated detection systems. While not immediate, patterns of automated behavior are frequently detected and actioned against.

Q: Can I run this 24/7?
A: Possible technically, but significantly increases detection risk. Discord's systems monitor for unusual connection patterns and durations.

Q: Is there a graphical user interface (GUI)?
A: Currently, EXTER is command-line only. This keeps the tool lightweight and focused on the core educational purpose of understanding WebSocket connections.

Q: Why was EXTER created?
A: EXTER was developed for educational purposes only to:

Demonstrate WebSocket implementation with Discord's gateway

Show how voice channel connections work programmatically

Provide learning material about Discord's API structure

Explore the technical aspects of real-time communication protocols

Q: Can I modify this for other Discord features?
A: Yes, the code is open-source (MIT licensed) for educational study and modification. However, any modifications for actual use should consider Discord's ToS implications.

Q: What if my accounts get banned?
A: This is an expected risk when violating Discord's ToS. Only use disposable accounts that you're prepared to lose.

📊 Technical Details
How It Works
Token Validation: Uses Discord's REST API to validate each token

WebSocket Connection: Establishes individual WebSocket connections per token

Gateway Handshake: Completes Discord's gateway identification process

Voice State Update: Sends voice state update to join specified channel

Heartbeat Maintenance: Maintains connections with periodic heartbeats

Reconnection Logic: Automatically reconnects every 5 minutes

Performance Considerations
Memory Usage: Approximately 10-15MB per active connection

CPU Usage: Minimal during steady-state operation

Network: Each connection uses ~1-5KBps for heartbeats

Limitations: System resources determine maximum concurrent connections
